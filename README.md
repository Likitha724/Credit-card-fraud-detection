# FraudGuard is a machine learning-based system developed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The system leverages advanced models and techniques to ensure accurate detection in highly imbalanced datasets, providing financial institutions with a reliable tool to combat fraud.

# Key Features:
# Machine Learning Models Used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
LightGBM
Class Imbalance Handling using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
Model Evaluation with Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC-AUC Score
# Project Overview:
FraudGuard aims to minimize financial fraud by using machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious credit card transactions. The system processes the dataset, handles imbalances, and uses a variety of models to evaluate the effectiveness in detecting fraudulent behavior. The project has been optimized for speed and accuracy, and it provides a comprehensive performance evaluation.
